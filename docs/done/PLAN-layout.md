# Implementation Plan — Recon Pane Layout

Status: **COMPLETE 2026-07-22.** Phases 1 and 2 done (2026-07-20); tab ceiling
resolved (`.tabs` wraps via `auto-fill`); and all four open questions now resolved
(pane widened 390→440; the other three decided — see "Open questions").

## Goal

Give the map back the screen. Two permanently-docked side panes cost 730px, so
on a laptop the map — the primary artifact of a situational-awareness tool — is
a minority of the display.

## Evidence

Measured 2026-07-20 against the running app:

| Viewport | Map width | Map share |
| -------- | --------- | --------- |
| 1280 (13") | 550px | **43%** |
| 1440 (14") | 710px | 49% |
| 1600 (16") | 870px | 54% |
| 1920 | 1190px | 62% |

The cost is lopsided between the two panes:

- **The left pane earns its space.** Layer toggling is continuous, and after the
  collapsible-group work it is dense and scannable.
- **The right pane mostly does not.** In its default Crypto state, **490px of its
  800px height is an empty result box** (61% empty). It holds burst-use tooling —
  look up a wallet, check an IP, read alerts — behind permanent chrome.

That the `‹ ›` collapse toggles already exist is itself the tell: they were added
because the panes were too big.

## Non-goals

- **The left pane is not in scope.** Grouping fixed its scaling problem.
- **No change to what the recon tools do.** This is where they live, not what
  they are.
- **No mobile redesign.** Below 1081px the shell already stacks vertically and
  the overlay approach must not apply there.

## Phase 1 — Recon collapsed by default — DONE (2026-07-20)

The pane stays exactly as it is; it just starts closed. Map goes **43% → 73%** at
1280px, and the pane is one click away on the existing toggle.

**Implementation.** `loadStore()` currently returns `{}` when nothing is saved,
so `store.hideRight` is `undefined` → falsy → pane shown. Seed the default so it
applies only when the key is *absent*:

```js
function loadStore() {
  try {
    const saved = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(STORAGE_KEY) || "{}") || {};
    // Spread saved LAST so an explicit `hideRight: false` (the user opened it)
    // survives; only an absent key picks up the default.
    return { hideRight: true, ...saved };
  } catch {
    return { hideRight: true };
  }
}
```

Everything else already works: `applyPaneState()` reads `store.hideRight`, sets
the class, flips the chevron, and calls `state.map.resize()`.

**Note:** existing users have a saved store with no `hideRight` key, so they will
pick up the new default on next load. That is intended, but it is a visible
change to anyone already using it.

*Verify:* fresh profile opens with the map at ~73% and the pane closed; clicking
`›` opens it and that choice survives a reload; the map canvas resizes (no
letterboxing).

**Verified** via Playwright, measured not eyeballed:

| Check | Result |
| ----- | ------ |
| 1280, fresh profile | map 940px = **73%** (was 550px / 43%), pane closed |
| Explicit open + reload | `hideRight:false` persists, back to 550px / 43% |
| 900px (stacked) | `hide-right` class applies but is inert — pane still 885×280 |
| 8 rapid toggles | canvas width tracks region every time, 0 console errors |

Testing gotcha for Phase 2: clearing `localStorage` from a live page does **not**
give a fresh profile — the in-memory `store` is rewritten whole by the next
`persist()` (the map viewport handler fires on resize), restoring the old
`hideRight`. Clear and reload in the same evaluate call.

---

## Phase 2 — Recon as an overlay — DONE (2026-07-20)

Burst-use tooling should not hold permanent width. The recon pane now slides
**over** the map rather than displacing it.

**What was built:**

- `.app-shell` is two columns (sidebar + map) above 1081px; the recon pane leaves
  the grid.
- `.recon` is `position: absolute` within `.app-shell` — **not** `.map-region` as
  planned, which avoided moving it in the DOM. It is pinned right, full height,
  `translateX(100%)` when closed, with `visibility: hidden` delayed until the
  slide finishes so an off-canvas pane is not tab-focusable.
- `#toggle-right` drives the same `store.hideRight` flag — state model unchanged.
- The canvas no longer changes size on toggle (measured: 940px in both states).
- All of it sits inside `@media (min-width: 1081px)`; below that the pane is
  `position: static` and the flag is inert.
- Geometry lives in `--recon-width` / `--pane-transition` on `:root`.

**Map centring — solved more cheaply than planned.** MapLibre's camera `padding`
is **sticky transform state**, not a per-call option. So `syncMapPadding()` sets
it once on toggle and *every* camera move is re-centred — all seven `flyTo` sites,
plus `fitBounds` and the restored viewport — **without touching a single call
site**. The planned `flyToEntity()` helper was not needed and was not built.

`reconOverlayWidth()` reads the live element width (so padding cannot drift from
`--recon-width`) and detects the breakpoint via computed `position === "absolute"`
rather than duplicating `1081px` in JS.

**Correction to this plan's premise.** It claimed an un-padded `flyTo` centres
entities *behind* the overlay. Measured against MapLibre 4.7.1, that is only true
in a narrow band — the centre of the canvas is left of the overlay at most widths:

| Viewport | Map region | Bare `flyTo` x | Overlay starts | Verdict |
| -------- | ---------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------- |
| 1081 | 741 | 371 | 351 | **hidden** (−19px) |
| 1120 | 780 | 390 | 390 | exactly at the edge |
| 1280 | 940 | 470 | 550 | visible, 80px clearance |
| 1440 | 1100 | 550 | 710 | visible, 160px |
| 1920 | 1580 | 790 | 1190 | visible, 400px |

Padded, the target lands at the centre of the *visible* strip every time (275 at
1280). So padding is still right — it is just fixing "off-centre and crowded
against the pane, hidden below ~1120px", not "always hidden".

**The thing that actually bit: the topbar.** The plan flagged `.entity-detail`
but missed that `.topbar` is also pinned to the map region's right edge — and
`#toggle-right` lives at its right end. With the overlay open the close button sat
at x=1220 underneath a pane starting at x=890 (`elementFromPoint` returned a recon
`tab`), so **the pane could be opened but not closed**. Both `.topbar` and
`.entity-detail` now shift by `calc(var(--recon-width) + 18px)` when open.

**Known cost:** animating the padding fires `moveend`, and `refreshViewportAware()`
refetches unconditionally on `moveend` — so toggling the pane triggers one Overpass
refetch when the `infrastructure` layer is enabled. A toggle is a deliberate,
infrequent action, so this was accepted rather than adding a suppression flag. If
Overpass rate-limiting becomes a problem, gate `refreshViewportAware` on an actual
bbox change.

*Verified* (Playwright, measured):

| Check | Result |
| ----- | ------ |
| Canvas resize on toggle | none — 940px across 8 toggles, one distinct width |
| Camera padding | 0 closed / 390 open / 0 below 1081px |
| Centre drift over 4 open-close pairs | exactly 0 |
| `#toggle-right` reachable | clickable in both states (872 ≤ 890 when open) |
| Detail card vs pane | card ends 872, pane starts 890 — no overlap |
| Fly with pane open | Tokyo lands centred in the visible strip |
| 1000px stacked | `position: static`, padding 0, layout unchanged |
| Console errors | 0 |
| `npm test` | 288 pass |

## The tab ceiling — RESOLVED 2026-07-21

Measured at 1280: seven tabs at 44-58px each, none clipped **yet**. An eighth
drops them to ~38px and "Sanctions" begins truncating.

**Fixed when the Econ + Entity tabs (8th, 9th) landed:** `.tabs` moved from
`grid-template-columns: repeat(7, 1fr)` to `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(62px, 1fr))`,
so the bar now **wraps to a second row** (~5 per row) instead of clipping. No
overlay widening or vertical rail needed; the ceiling is gone for future tabs
too. The pane can still be widened via `--recon-width` if a single-row look is
ever wanted back.

## Testing

The layout is CSS and cannot be unit-tested here (no browser test runner — the
zero-dep rule stands). Verify via Playwright, as with the previous layout work,
measuring rather than eyeballing:

- map width / viewport width at 1280 and 1920, pane open and closed
- `.recon` is not below the fold and its inner scroll areas still scroll
- a fly with the pane open lands the entity outside the overlay's rectangle
- at 900px wide the stacked layout is byte-identical to today
- no console errors after toggling repeatedly (listener accumulation)

## Open questions — RESOLVED 2026-07-22

All four were left open by Phase 2. Resolved after using the overlay in the built
app; three landed on the documented lean, one (width) was implemented.

1. **Dismissible by clicking the map? → NO (keep the explicit ‹/› toggle).**
   The risk of closing it mid-lookup (typing an address, reading results) outweighs
   the minor convenience, and the toggle is discoverable. It's an intentional
   overlay, not an accidental one. Cheap to revisit if it annoys in real use.
2. **Auto-open the pane when a recon tab is opened from elsewhere? → DEFER (N/A today).**
   There are no deep-links into recon tabs: recon-history lives *inside* the pane
   (so it's already open) and place-search has no tab. Revisit if a deep-link is
   ever added (e.g. an alert notification → Alerts tab) — at which point auto-open
   is the right behavior.
3. **Is 390px still right once it floats? → NO — widened to 440px (DONE).**
   Measured: with 11 recon tabs, 390 wrapped the bar to an awkward 3 rows [5,5,1];
   `--recon-width: 440px` gives a clean [6,5] two rows (460 gains nothing). One-line
   change on `:root`; CSS width, the topbar/entity shift, and the camera padding all
   read the var. As an overlay it costs the map nothing while closed.
4. **Does the left (layers) pane want the same overlay treatment? → NO (stays docked).**
   It's in continuous use — you toggle layers constantly — and overlaying it would
   hide the very list you're interacting with. The map-reclaim win came from the
   recon overlay; the left pane already collapses via its own toggle when the map
   needs the room. Revisit only if the map still feels cramped after that.
